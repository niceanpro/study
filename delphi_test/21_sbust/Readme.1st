Installing from the downloaded ZIP file Sbuster.zip
---------------------------------------------------

Run the file "Install.exe" from a temporary
directory and install to a hard drive of your
choice.

You must have IDAPI installed, and set up an Alias
called "Academic" defined that points to the 
X:\SBUSTER\DATA directory.  See Readme.txt
for further instructions (launches by default 
after Install).
