sodium.jar can be built with Java 5 or higher, but it's recommended you use Java 8
if you can. The lambda syntax makes your FRP code a lot nicer to write.


BUILD WITH ANT

Ant targets:

    ant clean   <-- clean all built files
    ant jar     <-- build sodium/sodium.jar
    ant tests   <-- build and run the test cases (requires java8 with lambda support)


BUILD WITH MAVEN:

    mvn install


--- Support for Java 5:
Only the ant build can build the Java 5 (JDK 1.5) version of the jar file.
If you don't have Java 8 (JDK 1.8) installed, then to avoid the 1.8 build you'll
need to type

    ant jar-old
